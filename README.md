Distributed fully-trusted Lottery Telegram Bot in Solidity language

## Bot

I built a telegram bot so everyone can participate in a fully-trusted, distributed lottery.  
You can register through the telegram bot (@CrystoLottery), choose your tokens and win a huge prize if you're lucky.

## Smart Contract

The contract was written in solidity. The contract collects all the mnoney and tokens from the participants and draws the winners randomly.  
After that the money is automatically calculated and sent to the winners.

## Simulations

I created some scenarios to debug and test the smart contract on a test network.

## NFT

With the help of selenium, I created a bot that scrolls OpenSea and downloads NFTs from the website automatically. Due to OpenSea's 
security measures it is impossible to download NFT images directly by using URLs.
